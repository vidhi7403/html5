Q:WHAT ARE THE NEW TAGS ADDED IN HTML?
As we know that HTML5 is a new version of HTML ( Hypertext markup language). HTML5 introduced many new tags that will benefit many developers. These tags are generally supported by all major browsers. These tags belong to many aspects such as graphics, media, and forms.

List of all elements introduced in HTML5:

<article> tag: The <article> tag is one of the new sectioning element in HTML5. The HTML <article> tag is used to represent an article. More specifically, the content within the <article> tag is independent of the other content of the site (even though it can be related).
<aside> tag: The <aside> tag is used to describe the main object of the web page in a shorter way like a highlighter. It basically identifies the content that is related to the primary content of the web page but does not constitute the main intent of the primary page. The <aside> tag contains mainly author information, links, related content, and so on.



Q:HOW TO EMBED AUDIO AND VIDEO IN A WEBPAGE?
HTML5 features include native audio and video support without the need for Flash.

The HTML5 <audio> and <video> tags make it simple to add media to a website. You need to set src attribute to identify the media source and include a controls attribute so the user can play and pause the media.

Embedding Video
Here is the simplest form of embedding a video file in your webpage −

<video src = "foo.mp4"  width = "300" height = "200" controls>
   Your browser does not support the <video> element.   
</video>
Video Attribute Specification
The HTML5 video tag can have a number of attributes to control the look and feel and various functionalities of the control −

Sr.No.	Attribute & Description
1.autoplay

This Boolean attribute if specified, the video will automatically begin to play back as soon as it can do so without stopping to finish loading the data.

2.autobuffer

This Boolean attribute if specified, the video will automatically begin buffering even if it's not set to automatically play.The current HTML5 draft specification does not specify which video formats browsers should support in the video tag. But most commonly used video formats are −

Ogg − Ogg files with Thedora video codec and Vorbis audio codec.

mpeg4 − MPEG4 files with H.264 video codec and AAC audio codec.
Embedding Audio
HTML5 supports <audio> tag which is used to embed sound content in an HTML or XHTML document as follows.

<audio src = "foo.wav" controls autoplay>
   Your browser does not support the <audio> element.   
</audio>
The current HTML5 draft specification does not specify which audio formats browsers should support in the audio tag. But most commonly used audio formats are ogg, mp3 and wav.





Q:SEMANTIC ELEMENT IN HTML?
A semantic element clearly describes its meaning to both the browser and the developer.

Examples of non-semantic elements: <div> and <span> - Tells nothing about its content.

Examples of semantic elements: <form>, <table>, and <article> - Clearly defines its content.

Semantic Elements in HTML
Many web sites contain HTML code like: <div id="nav"> <div class="header"> <div id="footer"> to indicate navigation, header, and footer.In HTML there are some semantic elements that can be used to define different parts of a web page:  

        <article>
        <aside>
        <details>
        <figcaption>
        <figure>
        <footer>
        <header>
        <main>
        <mark>
        <nav>
        <section>
        <summary>
        <time>





Q:CANVAS AND SVG TAGS?
SVG: The Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) is an XML-based image format that is used to define two-dimensional vector-based graphics for the web. Unlike raster image (Ex .jpg, .gif, .png, etc.), a vector image can be scaled up or down to any extent without losing the image quality.

An SVG image is drawn out using a series of statements that follow the XML schema — that means SVG images can be created and edited with any text editor, such as Notepad. There are several other advantages of using SVG over other image formats like JPEG, GIF, PNG, etc.

Canvas: The HTML element is used to draw graphics on the fly, via scripting (usually JavaScript). The element is only a container for graphics. You must use a script to actually draw the graphics. Canvas has several methods for drawing paths, boxes, circles, text, and adding images.
